****Objective:**** In this project, we attempt to perform a Multi-Label Text Classification on news articles. The comprehensive dataset is provided by The Guardian (news agency) and is a data challenge called Growing Instability.

****Multi-Label Text Classification**** 

Separating data into individual categories is called a ‘Multi-Class’ classification problem. Here every instance is put into one group or category. But there are several business use cases which require classifying the data into more than one groups or labels. For example, a photograph related to a crime scene may be categorized into the labels – “crime”, “murder”. This approach of classifying data into multiple categories or labels is called as a ‘Multi-Label’ classification problem. A multi-label classification problem arises in a variety of domains such as labeling multimedia resources such as images, videos and audio files, genetics/biology, and text classification such as emails, documents, reports, patents and the most popular – web pages. Classification of text into multiple labels is called a “Multi-Label Text Classification” problem. 

****What we did****

The goal is to correctly classify new news articles into various topics. This classification would help the team in question to focus and apply their resources on those areas pertinent to them. Our approaches to this problem consisted of applying algorithms such as Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, Dependent Binary Relevance, OneVsAll using Naive Bayes and OneVsAll using Stochastic Gradient Descent. We then compared the performance of these multi-label text classification algorithms.
